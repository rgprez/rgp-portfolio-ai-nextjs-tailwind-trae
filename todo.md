# Project To-Do List

This document outlines the tasks for the project, following the workflow defined in `project_rules.md`.

## Phase 1: Foundational Build (Layout, Styles & Content) - COMPLETE

### To-Do Items:

- [x] **Project Initialization**
  - [x] Create a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS v4 setup.
  - [x] Configure `src/app/globals.css` for Tailwind CSS v4 (config-free).
  - [x] Verify basic Tailwind CSS styling is working.
  - [x] Initialize Git repository and make initial commit
  - [x] Create GitHub repository and push initial commit

### Layout and Content Implementation: - COMPLETE

- [x] Define core layout components (e.g., Header, Footer, Main Content Area).
- [x] Implement static content for the Home page.
- [x] Implement static content for the About page.
- [x] Implement static content for the Projects page.
- [x] Implement static content for the Contact page.
- [x] Ensure all static content is sourced from `website_copy_structure.md`.

### Next Steps (from awwwards_design_implementation_plan.md):



  - [x] Implement responsive design breakpoints.
    - [x] Define a set of standard breakpoints based on common device sizes and the Awwwards design. (Tailwind CSS v4 provides these by default)
    - [x] Apply responsive utility classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to existing components (Header, Footer, and main content areas) to ensure proper scaling and layout adjustments. (Implemented responsive navigation in `Header.tsx`)
    - [x] Test responsiveness across various screen sizes using browser developer tools.

### Review: Responsive Design Implementation

- **Header Component (`src/components/Header.tsx`):** Implemented a responsive navigation menu using React's `useState` hook and Tailwind CSS utility classes (`md:hidden`, `md:flex`, `absolute`, `md:static`, `top-16`, `left-0`, `w-full`, `md:w-auto`, `bg-color-background`, `md:bg-transparent`, `p-4`, `md:p-0`). This allows the navigation to collapse into a hamburger icon on small screens and expand on larger screens.
  - [x] Create reusable global components (e.g., buttons, forms).cards, forms)
  - **Review:** Extracted Hero Section, Philosophy Section, Demos Section, and Audience Benefits Section into their own components: <mcfile name="HeroSection.tsx" path="src/components/HeroSection.tsx"></mcfile>, <mcfile name="PhilosophySection.tsx" path="src/components/PhilosophySection.tsx"></mcfile>, <mcfile name="DemosSection.tsx" path="src/components/DemosSection.tsx"></mcfile>, and <mcfile name="AudienceBenefitsSection.tsx" path="src/components/AudienceBenefitsSection.tsx"></mcfile>. The <mcfile name="page.tsx" path="src/app/page.tsx"></mcfile> file was updated to use these new components..
- [x] **Phase 1: Hero Section â€“ 'The Awakening'**
  - [x] Implement the core layout and static content for the Hero section.
    - [x] Create HeroBackground.tsx component for 3D background
    - [x] Enhance headline with typing and glitch effects
    - [x] Add clip-path reveal animation for subheadline
    - [x] Implement staggered fade-in-up for paragraph text
    - [x] Add cursor interactivity with the 3D background
  - [x] Apply initial styling based on the design plan.
    - [x] Update color scheme to match the dark-first aesthetic
    - [x] Improve typography with proper spacing and hierarchy
    - [x] Add responsive padding and margins
  - [x] Ensure responsiveness across devices.

#### Phase 0: Foundational Build (Layout, Styles & Content)
  - [x] Set up global styles and typography (Geist fonts, Tailwind CSS v4 config-free setup).
    - **Review:**
      - Updated `src/app/globals.css` to import Geist fonts and correctly apply Tailwind CSS directives, ensuring compliance with Tailwind CSS v4 by replacing `@tailwind` directives with a single `@import "tailwindcss";` statement.
      - Modified `src/components/Header.tsx` and `src/components/Footer.tsx` to use `bg-color-background` and `text-color-foreground` for consistent global styling.
  - [x] Resolve Geist font loading issue (conflicts with Tailwind CSS).
    - Removed Geist font imports from `src/app/globals.css` and `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    - Applied `font-sans` class to the `html` tag in `src/app/layout.tsx` to set a default sans-serif font.
  - [x] Implement responsive design breakpoints.
    - [x] Define a set of standard breakpoints based on common device sizes and the Awwwards design. (Tailwind CSS v4 provides these by default)
    - [x] Apply responsive utility classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to existing components (Header, Footer, and main content areas) to ensure proper scaling and layout adjustments. (Implemented responsive navigation in `Header.tsx`)
    - [x] Test responsiveness across various screen sizes using browser developer tools.
  - [x] Create reusable global components (e.g., buttons, forms).cards, forms)
  - [x] Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - [x] Adjust animations for different screen sizes

## Phase 2: Animation System Scaffolding - COMPLETE

### Hero Section Height and Background Fixes (2025-07-16)

- **HeroSection Height Issue:**

  - **Problem:** The `HeroSection` appeared to be double the viewport height.
  - **Resolution:**
    - Modified <mcfile name="HeroSection.tsx" path="src/components/HeroSection.tsx"></mcfile> to change its height from `min-h-screen` to `h-screen`, ensuring it occupies exactly the viewport height.
    - Updated <mcfile name="HeroBackground.tsx" path="src/components/HeroBackground.tsx"></mcfile> to add `h-full` and `w-full` to its container `div`, ensuring the background is constrained to its parent's dimensions.
    - Adjusted the Three.js renderer, resize handling, camera initialization, and mouse position tracking in <mcfile name="HeroBackground.tsx" path="src/components/HeroBackground.tsx"></mcfile> to use the container's dimensions (`containerRef.current.clientWidth`, `containerRef.current.clientHeight`) instead of `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`.

- **HeroBackground.tsx TypeScript Errors:**
  - **Problem:** Redeclaration errors for `containerWidth` and `containerHeight` variables within `HeroBackground.tsx`.
  - **Resolution:** Renamed the redeclared variables to be context-specific:
    - `cameraContainerWidth` and `cameraContainerHeight` for camera initialization.
    - `rendererContainerWidth` and `rendererContainerHeight` for renderer initialization.
    - `resizeContainerWidth` and `resizeContainerHeight` within the `handleResize` function.
    - `mouseContainerWidth` and `mouseContainerHeight` for mouse position updates.

## Review Section:

### Phase 1: Foundational Build - Layout and Content Implementation

- **Header and Footer Components:** Created `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` in `src/components` and integrated them into `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- **Home Page Content:** Implemented static content for the Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) including a hero section, about section, and projects section.
- **About Page Content:** Created `src/app/about/page.tsx` and added static content for the About page.
- **Projects Page Content:** Created `src/app/projects/page.tsx` and added static content for the Projects page, including a list of project cards.
- **Contact Page Content:** Created `src/app/contact/page.tsx` and added static content for the Contact page, including a contact form.

All core layout components are defined and static content for all primary pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact) has been implemented.

### Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Global Elements

- **Global Styles (`src/app/globals.css`):** Updated to import Geist fonts and include Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`). The `font-family` for the `body` element was updated to use `var(--font-sans)`.
- **Header Component (`src/components/Header.tsx`):** Updated to use `bg-color-background` and `text-color-foreground` for consistency with the new global styling approach.
- **Footer Component (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):** Updated to use `bg-color-background` and `text-color-foreground` for consistency with the new global styling approach.

### Review: Font Loading Issue Resolution

- **Issue:** `Can't resolve '@fontsource/geist-sans/variable.css'` error during `npm run dev`.
- **Resolution:** Installed `@fontsource/geist-sans` package using `pnpm`.
- **Verification:** Development server started successfully, and the preview confirmed fonts are loading correctly.

### Summary of Changes:

- Initialized a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and `src` directory using `pnpm`.
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with the config-free approach.
- Verified basic Tailwind CSS styling by adding a styled `<h1>` tag to `src/app/page.tsx`.

### Next Steps:

- Proceed with Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Global Elements and Phase 1: Hero Section â€“ 'The Awakening' as outlined in `awwwards_design_implementation_plan.md`.
