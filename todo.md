## Review Section:

### Phase 1: Foundational Build - Layout and Content Implementation

- **Header and Footer Components:** Created `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` in `src/components` and integrated them into `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- **Home Page Content:** Implemented static content for the Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) including a hero section, about section, and projects section.
- **About Page Content:** Created `src/app/about/page.tsx` and added static content for the About page.
- **Projects Page Content:** Created `src/app/projects/page.tsx` and added static content for the Projects page, including a list of project cards.
- **Contact Page Content:** Created `src/app/contact/page.tsx` and added static content for the Contact page, including a contact form.

All core layout components are defined and static content for all primary pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact) has been implemented. The next step is to verify these changes in the browser.

### Summary of Changes:
- Initialized a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and `src` directory using `pnpm`.
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with the config-free approach.
- Verified basic Tailwind CSS styling by adding a styled `<h1>` tag to `src/app/page.tsx`.

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Global Elements and Phase 1: Hero Section – 'The Awakening' as outlined in `awwwards_design_implementation_plan.md`.
