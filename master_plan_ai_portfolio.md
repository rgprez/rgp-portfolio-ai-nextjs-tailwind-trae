# üöÄ Master Plan: AI-Enhanced Portfolio as Narrative Journey

## üåü Vision Statement

Craft a portfolio that feels like an **AI-narrated interactive storybook** ‚Äî a blend of intelligent structure, visual storytelling, and subtle motion.\
Each section flows like a scene in a digital comic, revealing not just past work, but the thought process and creativity behind it.

---

## üß† Guiding Principles

1. **Content & Structure First** ‚Äî Lock in layout, hierarchy, and messaging before layering animation.
2. **Narrative Flow** ‚Äî Think of the site like an animated, intelligent comic book: each scroll reveals the next scene or insight.
3. **Progressive Enhancement** ‚Äî Content must remain accessible and understandable even with all animations disabled.
4. **Accessible Immersion** ‚Äî All interactions and motion must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and keyboard/screen-reader requirements.
5. **Performance-Conscious** ‚Äî Prioritize GPU-friendly CSS transforms, lazy loading, and animation frame budgeting.

## üì∫ Implementation Roadmap

### üîπ Phase 1: Layout, Styles & Content (2 weeks) - COMPLETE

**Goal**: Build a complete, accessible, unanimated portfolio with finalized layout and real content.

-

> ‚úÖ **Deliverable**: A visually polished portfolio site with finalized structure, copy, and theme ‚Äî no animations yet.

---

### üîπ Phase 2: Animation System Scaffolding (1 week) - COMPLETE

**Goal**: Prepare infrastructure for future animation, but do not apply it yet.

-

---

### üîπ Phase 3: Narrative Animations (3‚Äì4 weeks) - COMPLETE

**Goal**: Layer animation onto each section sequentially to reinforce narrative flow.

#### Hero ("Awakening")

-

#### About ("Origin Story")

-

#### Demos ("Interactive Gallery")

-

#### Philosophy ("Why This Matters")

-

#### CTA ("Final Scene")

-

> ‚úÖ **Deliverable**: Fully animated story-like portfolio experience with flow and emotional pacing.

### üîπ Phase 4 (Optional): Advanced AI-Like Enhancements (2 weeks)

## üì¶ Animation Variants Example (Motion.dev / Framer-compatible)

```ts
// src/animations/variants.ts
export const typing = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: (i = 1) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { delay: i * 0.05, duration: 0.4 },
  }),
};

export const clipReveal = {
  hidden: { clipPath: 'inset(0 100% 0 0)', opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    clipPath: 'inset(0 0% 0 0)',
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { duration: 0.8, ease: [0.33, 1, 0.68, 1] },
  },
};

export const fadeInUp = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 16 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.5 } },
};
```

## üìä Success Metrics

| Area              | Target                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**   | >90 Lighthouse perf score                       |
| **Motion Safety** | Full `prefers-reduced-motion` support           |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard nav, ARIA                 |
| **UX Flow**       | Smooth narrative pacing across scroll           |
| **Engagement**    | Time on page, click-throughs, interaction depth |

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Workflow

1. Finalize and lock layout and copy first
2. Build and test base layout across viewports
3. Scaffold animation system (Phase 2) but apply nothing
4. Add animation scene-by-scene with testing and reduced-motion variants
5. Review, refine, and ship

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

| Risk                            | Mitigation                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Layout rework breaks animations | Lock layout before starting animation (Phase 1 hard stop)                |
| Motion overload                 | Set animation budget per scene; test `prefers-reduced-motion`            |
| Performance drops               | Use GPU-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`), lazy-load when possible |
| Overcomplication                | Use composable, section-scoped motion wrappers and clear fallbacks       |

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline

| Phase                                  | Time                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Phase 1 ‚Äì Layout, Styles, Content      | 2 weeks                 |
| Phase 2 ‚Äì Animation System Setup       | 1 week                  |
| Phase 3 ‚Äì Section-by-Section Animation | 3‚Äì4 weeks               |
| Phase 4 ‚Äì Optional Enhancements        | 2 weeks                 |
| **Total Estimate**                     | 8‚Äì9 weeks (with buffer) |
